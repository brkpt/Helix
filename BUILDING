Requirements:
- JamPlus 3 : git@github.com:brkpt/jamplus.git
- LuaPlus   : git@github.com:brkpt/luaplus51-all.git

JamPlus is required in order to build LuaPlus and the DeferredShader project.  

Building JamPlus:
- Run the bootstrapping script for your platform (probably bootstrap-win32.bat or 
  bootstrap-win64.bat)
- This will generate a jam.exe in the bin folder.  Make sure that folder is on your path
  in order to build LuaPlus.

Buildling LuaPlus:
- Run the CreateWorkspaceVS2015.bat 
- Select either Lua 5.2 
- Load the solution in build2015/_workspaces_/vs2015 into Visual Studio 2015.
- Build the lua52-static project.
- Copy the libraries into a known location inside of a lib folder
- Edit the root Jamfile.jam and change the LUAPLUS variable to point to the known location (expects the 
  .lib files to be in $LUAPLUS/lib).
